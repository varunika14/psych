            <h1>Self-Therapy</h1>
            <p>It's not always easy, or affordable, to go to a therapist.
                 But that doesn't mean you can't do a little DIY therapy on your own.</p>
             <p>The concept refers very broadly to the idea of treating 
                 one’s own emotional or psychological problems, without the help of a therapist.</p>    
            <h1>Ways to do Self Thearpy:</h1>
            <p>1. Start now and then practice every day.Think of a problem you'd like to work on.</p>
                <br>
                <p>2. Study your problem.Split the problem into two parts: The practical part and the emotional/behavioral part.
                Focus on the feelings and actions you'd like to change.</p>

                <p>Don't try to solve the practical problem until you've fixed your emotions.
                Look for unhelpful feelings and actions.
                Don't try to change helpful feelings (even if they're unpleasant).</p>
        
               <p> 3.Study your feelings and action.What is the name of your unhelpful emotion (e.g., anxiety, anger, depression, etc.)?
                Ask yourself how you feel about the practical problem.</p>
                
                
                <!--4. Create and reinforce a new rational belief.-->

              <p>4.Remember the three parts of a rational belief:<br>
                1. State what you want (or don't want).<br>
                2. State that you don't need to have what you want.<br>
                3. Join the two statements with a "but."
                E.g., "I want to succeed but I don't need to succeed."
                Force yourself to actually believe the new, rational belief.
                New Beliefs have to be repeated regularly to "feel" them.
                Old Beliefs have to be disputed regularly to stop "feeling" them.
                
               <p> 5.Keep records.</p>

              
                <p>6. Make your new rational beliefs permanent.
                
                Look for similar problems and apply your new rational beliefs to those situations.
                Look for changes in the frequency, intensity, and/or duration of your unhelpful feelings.
                Remind yourself regularly that your progress is up to you.</p>
